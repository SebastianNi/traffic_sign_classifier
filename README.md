# Project: Traffic Sign Classifier
## My 2nd Project in the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project

### Project Overview
In this project, I used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) as well as the file [**signnames.csv**](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/signnames.csv) from the Udacity project repository.

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb```
